# sobekcm-plugin-builder-demo-modules

Example builder modules as a plug-in.  

One example module includes processing non-BibID:VID type folder by the builder as a custom folder builder module.

The second example builder module included does simple logging in an external file as each item is processed.  This is a single item builder module.

This was developed as a demonstration plug-in during the SobekCM Code Camp 2017 in Cape Canaveral, FL.
